    "These wrangling steps may be named in a specific way; however they are generic for a two-dimension pull of data from the census API.Wrangling from an Excel spreadsheet differs as observations are related to their dimensions positionally, not explicitly machine navigatable. The JSON response form the Census API is dependably formatted, so long as I'm accessing v1 of the API, I can continue to unpack these responses in the same way. Excel workbooks do not share this same promise."
